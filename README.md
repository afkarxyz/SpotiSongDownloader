<div align="center">
<b>SpotiSongDownloader</b> is a GUI tool designed to help download Spotify tracks from <b>spotisongdownloader.to</b> without limits.
</div>

#
**spotisongdownloader.to** gives users a distinct edge by allowing them to download original M4A files directly from the source. This ensures better audio quality compared to other platforms that often rely on lower-quality tracks sourced from YouTube.

To overcome the site's limitation of 3 downloads per day, I created this lightweight tool to bypass the daily download restriction.
