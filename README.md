## About

**SpotiSongDownloader** is a GUI tool designed to download tracks from **spotisongdownloader.to**

One of the main advantages of **spotisongdownloader.to** is that it allows you to obtain original 256K M4A files directly from Spotify, unlike other platforms that often provide lower-quality versions sourced from YouTube. 

However, since the site imposes a limit of 3 tracks per day, I developed this lightweight software to bypass the daily download restriction.

> [!NOTE]  
> Requires **Google Chrome.**
