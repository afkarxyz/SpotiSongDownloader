> [!Important]
> This project is **temporarily suspended** and Iâ€™m not fixing it because `SpotiSongDownloader.to` currently downloads files from **YouTube**, not from the original source like before. Please use [SpotiDownloader](https://github.com/afkarxyz/SpotiDownloader), which also downloads from YouTube. Or if you want something better, use [Spotizer](https://github.com/afkarxyz/Spotizer), which downloads from `Deezer`. And if you want true FLAC quality, please use [SpotiFLAC](https://github.com/afkarxyz/SpotiFLAC).
